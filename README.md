# ClosestToZero

In this exercise, I have to analyze temperature records to find the closest to zero. 
Sample temperatures. Here, -1.7 is the closest to 0. Implement the function closestToZero to return the temperature closer to zero which belongs to the array ts.

If ts is empty, return 0 (zero).

If two numbers are as close to zero, consider the positive number as the closest to zero (eg. if ts contains -5 and 5, return 5).

Input:
Temperatures are always expressed with floating-point numbers ranging from -273 to 5526.
ts is always a valid array and is never null.
